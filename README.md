# Data Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This is a Jupiter notebook that is part from a bigger project. This part extracts the data from the Azure Database and uses it to predict future pollution values and sends them back to the Java application. This notebook is designed to analyze and forecast pollution levels based on environmental and traffic data. It utilizes Python for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and time series forecasting, focusing on practical application by integrating predictions into business applications.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Includes fetching data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and outlier analysis.
- **Database Connection**: Steps to connect to an Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.
- **Analysis**: Conducts correlation analysis, seasonality, and trend analysis.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Uses the SARIMAX model to forecast pollution levels at various locations.
- **Visualization**: Plots predictions for visual analysis.
- **Export**: Converts forecast values into a JSON file and demonstrates how to send this file to a business application backend.

## Sections
1. **Imports**: Import necessary Python libraries.
2. **Data Storage**: Instructions on storing fetched data in a CSV file.
3. **Database Connection**: Connect to an Azure MySQL database and read data.
4. **Data Handling**: Instructions for inserting timestamps, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and outliers.
5. **Data Analysis**: Perform correlation analysis between pollution and traffic levels, seasonality, and trend analysis.
6. **Data Grouping**: Group data by location and prepare it for time series analysis.
7. **Forecasting**: Use the SARIMAX model to forecast pollution levels.
8. **Visualization**: Plot the forecasts for analysis.
9. **Export and Integration**: Steps to export the forecasts to a JSON file and integrate with business applications.

## Usage
To use this notebook effectively, follow these steps:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed as per the "Imports" section.
2. Store your environmental and traffic data in a CSV file as outlined.
3. Set up a connection to your Azure MySQL database.
4. Follow the notebook sections in order to prepare your data, analyze it, and generate forecasts.
5. Adjust the SARIMAX model parameters as needed to fit your specific data and forecasting needs.
6. Use the visualization section to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of your forecasts.
7. Export your forecasts to a JSON file and integrate them into your business application as demonstrated.

## Dependencies
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn

## Data Requirements
This notebook is designed to work with time-series data related to environmental pollution and traffic levels. Data should include timestamps, pollution measurements, traffic levels, and any other relevant environmental factors (e.g., wind speed, temperature).
